description : |
    <p>VirMatcher is a tool to predict virus-host relationships, leveraging a variety of bioinformatic methods,
    including; host CRISPR-spacers, integrated prophage, host tRNA genes, and k-mer signatures calculated by WIsH.
    The methodology is detailed in the publication section.</p>
