parameters :
    viral_genomes :
        ui-name : |
            Viral genome(s).
        short-hint : |
            Viral genome(s) as a KBase assembly object, each record is considered a separate viral genome.
        long-hint  : |
            Viral genome(s) as a KBase assembly object, where each record is considered a separate viral genome.
            Segmented genomes and/or fragmented components of the same genome are ignored.

    host_genomes:
        ui-name: |
            Potential microbial host genomes
        short-hint: |
            Potential microbial host genomes as one of KBase Assembly, Genomes, AssemblySet or BinnedContigs object.
        long-hint: |
            Potential microbial host genomes as one of KBase Assembly, Genomes, AssemblySet or BinnedContigs object.
            If Assembly, each record is considered a separate microbial genome. If GenomeS, each genome is considered a
            separate genome. If AsssemblySet, each assembly (within the set) is considered a separate genome. And if a
            BinnedContigs object, each binned set of contig(s) is considered a separate genome.

description : |
    <p>VirMatcher is a tool to predict virus-host relationships, leveraging a variety of bioinformatic methods,
    including; host CRISPR-spacers, integrated prophage, host tRNA genes, and k-mer signatures calculated by WIsH.

    A more thorough description of this tool (and the code it runs) is available at
    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/MAVERICLab/virmatcher/">py-VirMatcher</a>.

    Briefly, this App will consume viral genomes (in KBase.Asssembly object format) and suspected/putative/potential
    microbial genomes (in KBase.Assembly/Genomes/AssemblySet/BinnedContigs object formats), converts them into
    suitable inputs for <a href="https://ecogenomics.github.io/GTDBTk/index.html">GTDB-Tk</a>, runs GTDB-Tk to
    taxonomically classify the microbial genomes, and then passes that information to VirMatcher. VirMatcher uses a
    taxonomically-aware methodology and combines this with CRISPR spacer matches, BLAST search, tRNA matches, and
    <a href="https://github.com/soedinglab/WIsH">WIsH</a> predictions. The final result is an aggregated, scored table
    of all potential virus-host pairings.</p>
